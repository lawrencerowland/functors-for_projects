      <h1 className="font-serif text-2xl">Insights & Learning Hub</h1>
      <p className="font-sans">Welcome to the Insights & Learning Hub, a shared library of knowledge from our innovation journey. Here, teams post their lessons learned, success stories, and creative tips so that everyone can learn and improve together. Are you starting a new project? Browse the hub to see if someone has tackled a similar challenge and what they discovered. For example, one project team might share how using a certain brainstorming tool sped up their workshop, while another post outlines a clever way they adapted our planning framework for a tight timeline. All content is written to be general and applicable to many situations – you won’t find specific company jargon or confidential data, just the core nuggets of wisdom. This hub also features short articles on emerging best practices (like engaging stakeholders in virtual settings, or measuring the impact of a prototype). We encourage you to not only read and reuse these insights, but also to contribute your own. By reflecting on what we learn and freely sharing those insights, we ensure that each project makes the next one smarter and more successful. Knowledge is our most sustainable resource, and this page is where it grows.</p>
