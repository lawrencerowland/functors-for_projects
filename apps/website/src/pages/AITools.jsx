      <h1 className="font-serif text-2xl">AI Tools & Collaboration</h1>
      <p className="font-sans">This section highlights our suite of AI-powered collaboration tools that make project teamwork smarter and easier. Across the project lifecycle, intelligent assistants are available to help – from planning and design through to oversight and learning. For example, you can ask a chatbot to generate a first draft of a project brief or governance document, saving the team time on tedious paperwork. During implementation, an AI assistant can monitor project data to flag potential delays or risks, providing early warnings to the team. We also offer AI-driven analysis for assurance and measurement: imagine an algorithm that reviews project updates and suggests where to focus a quality audit, or automatically compiles lessons learned across projects into insights before key decision gates. All these features are designed to boost collaboration – the AI tools handle routine analysis and document generation, so that human teams can spend more time on creative problem-solving and decision-making. By integrating AI gently into everyday workflows, the platform helps even non-technical users leverage advanced technology to achieve better outcomes.</p>
