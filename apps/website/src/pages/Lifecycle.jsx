      <h1 className="font-serif text-2xl">Project Lifecycle & Governance</h1>
      <p className="font-sans">Every project benefits from a clear roadmap. In this section, we present a generic project lifecycle – from idea inception to final delivery – to help your team navigate each phase with confidence. Each stage (for example, Concept, Plan, Build, Launch, and Evaluate) is described with its typical goals and key decision points. We’ve also built in simple governance checkpoints (like sign-offs or retrospectives) to ensure your project stays on track and delivers value. These guidelines draw on proven project management principles – such as engaging stakeholders, focusing on value, and adapting to complexity – but we’ve kept them flexible. That means you can tailor steps to fit your project’s size and style; the framework is there to support you, not to create extra paperwork. For instance, at the end of each phase, the site can prompt you with a checklist (modeled on common standards) to reflect on progress and prepare for the next phase. By following this lightweight lifecycle, teams can combine creative agility with structured assurance, ensuring innovative ideas are developed responsibly and reach implementation successfully. New users and experienced project leaders alike can rely on this page as a quick reference for “what comes next” and how to meet good practice without any heavy manual – it’s all distilled here in a friendly, digestible format.</p>
