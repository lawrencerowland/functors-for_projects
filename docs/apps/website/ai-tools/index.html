  <h1>AI Tools &amp; Collaboration</h1>
  <p>This section highlights our suite of AI-powered collaboration tools that make project teamwork smarter and easier. Across the project lifecycle, intelligent assistants help from planning and design through to oversight and learning. For example, you can ask a chatbot to generate a first draft of a project brief or governance document, saving the team time on tedious paperwork. During implementation, an AI assistant can monitor project data to flag potential delays or risks, providing early warnings to the team. By integrating AI gently into everyday workflows, the platform helps even non-technical users leverage advanced technology to achieve better outcomes.</p>
