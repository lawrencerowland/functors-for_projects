  <h1>Systems Thinking &amp; Stakeholders</h1>
  <p>Successful innovation requires seeing the whole system. This section helps your team apply systems thinking so you can anticipate how changes in one area might impact others. Using simple maps and examples, we illustrate how a project’s stakeholders, processes and environment form an interconnected network – often with feedback loops and unexpected influences. By understanding your project as a dynamic system of many moving parts, you’ll be better equipped to respond to new challenges and keep stakeholders aligned.</p>
